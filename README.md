# GUI application for Rigid and Non-rigid Transformation techniques.

## **Introduction**

Implementing a GUI application for 3D Alignment/Transformation of meshes using Qt and C++.  
Aligning the 3D scans/meshes is one of the important task in statistical shape model fitting pipeline. For details regarding the alignment concepts, reader refer to my another repository called: Rigid and Non-rigid Transformation of two 3D Human full-body scans.
